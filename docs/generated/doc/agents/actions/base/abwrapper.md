## Class ActionWrapper

ActionWrapper works as an extra abstraction layer used by the agent to select actions. This means the agent doesn't select actions from action_set,
but from ActionWrapper. This class is responsible to telling the agents which actions it can use and which ones are excluded from selection. It can
also force the agent to use certain actions by combining them into multiple steps
