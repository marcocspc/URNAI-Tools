## Class StateBuilder

Every Agent needs to own an instance of this base class in order to define its State. So every time we want to create a new agent,
we should either use an existing State implementation or create a new one.

## Method build_state()

This method receives as a parameter an Observation and returns a State, which is usually a list of features extracted from the Observation. The Agent
uses this State during training to receive a new action from its model and also to make it learn, that's why this method should always return a list.

* Arguments: obs

## Method get_state_dim()

Returns the dimensions of the States returned by the build_state method.

* No Arguments.
