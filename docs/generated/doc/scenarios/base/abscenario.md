## Class ABScenario

Abstract class for all Scenarios supported. A Scenario works like an environment, but uses it
as a base to create a trainment pattern. For example, for an environment like DeepRTS, one can train an agent
to learn how to collect specific resources, on a specific map.

A scenario also offers a default RewardBuilder and ActionWrapper to help build an agent.
